# python-google-dino-clone
A clone of the popular browser game in Google Chrome. There are two python files in the repo: dino_game.py is the playable version of the game using keyboard controls, and dino_game_ai.py trains a neural network evolutionary algorithm to beat the dino game. This project depends on a few Python libraries, 'Pygame' and 'neat'. 

Seen below is a screenshot of the game when the player hits a cactus. The game is over and the program must be re-run in order to play again.

Here is a screenshot of the AI version of the game being run. As you can see, the generation and number of dino players is presented in the top left.
The program will run indefinitely as it continues to train and evolve the evolutionary neural network.
