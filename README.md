# python-google-dino-clone
A clone of the popular browser game in Google Chrome. There are two python files in the repo: dino_game.py is the playable version of the game using keyboard controls, and dino_game_ai.py trains a neural network evolutionary algorithm to beat the dino game. This project depends on a few Python libraries, 'Pygame' and 'neat'. 

Seen below is a screenshot of the game when the player hits a cactus. 
Use the spacebar to jump over the obstacles as they approach. The game 
speeds up the further you progress. When you hit a cactus, as shown below,the game is over and the program must be re-run in order to play again.

Please feel free to leave any comments/suggestions to improve my code! I'm still a beginner and would appreciate any constructive feedback.
